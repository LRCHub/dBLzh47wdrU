[00:01.98] So- fuck!
[00:06.48] 
[00:05.31] So unsure, before it's even heard
[00:08.57] Never confident in a single word
[00:11.71] This bird, expert in the absurd
[00:14.65] Number one in life that has been deferred
[00:17.65] It hurts this relentless introvert
[00:19.91] But inversion only serves to put deserving on the mind
[00:22.98] So I keep my time, so far out of line
[00:26.60] And when the day turns night, I can't help but
[00:49.60] 
[00:29.34] Cry so loudly, I slant devoutly
[00:32.10] Tell me what about me is built so wrong?
[00:35.08] There's so much passion
[00:36.64] But more I'm lacking
[00:38.16] I wish that I could c-c-c-c-c-c-c-caw-
[00:57.16] 
[00:41.73] But I falter on the forethought
[00:43.72] I keep on running like a chicken with its head cut off
[00:47.69] Achromatic twisted aeronaut
[00:49.77] A BIRDBRAIN, baby, I don't know when I'm supposed to stop
[00:53.34] Hit me with the flap down, crash into the soft ground (foul!)
[00:56.69] Ain't no fellow feathers falling for a freak (so weak!)
[00:59.30] So put my neck up on the chopping block
[01:01.84] A BIRDBRAIN, baby, I don't think my head is coming off
[01:05.71] Baby, I don't know when I'm supposed to stop
[01:08.75] Baby, I don't know when I'm supposed to stop!
[01:31.25] 
[01:11.24] So- shit-
[01:12.62] So unsure, before it's even heard
[01:16.17] I can't toe the border with my eyes so blurred
[01:19.18] This bird, constantly overturned
[01:21.72] Ten-time unwitting champion of being spurned
[01:25.34] (So when you go, I won't cry)
[01:28.26] 'Cause even though it hurts, it's the thousandth time
[01:31.21] Don't stay, cause I don't even know what I’d do anyway
[01:58.21] 
[01:36.65] I'm so damn selfish, I can't live like this
[01:39.66] So be my witness, I won't back down
[01:42.70] I'll play the hero, divide the zero
[01:45.39] So I wanna hear you s-say… something?
[02:03.89] 
[01:49.51] And I falter as an afterthought
[01:51.24] I keep on running like a chicken with its head cut off
[01:55.05] Apathetic aching argonaut
[01:57.31] A BIRDBRAIN, baby, I don't know when I’m supposed to stop
[02:00.83] Hit me with the flap down, crashing with a loud sound (foul!)
[02:04.19] Apoplectic and pathetic as can be (not me!)
[02:07.04] I put my neck up on the chopping block
[02:09.37] A BIRDBRAIN, baby, I don't think my head is coming off
[02:13.24] Baby, I don't know when I'm supposed to stop
[02:16.24] Can tell me if you think that I should stop?
[02:19.22] Baby, I don't know when I'm supposed to stop
[02:41.22] 
[02:23.22] (Why did it sound like that?!)
[02:38.22] 
[02:24.94] Is it all for a show?
[02:27.58] In the golden hour you seem to know no fear
[02:32.59] Is it really true?
[02:35.01] That a bird like me could never think like you?
[02:40.10] Is it all in my head?
[02:42.92] Is my ignorance just manufactured dread?
[02:47.46] When I've naught but my pride
[02:50.22] Can you take a look and
[02:52.43] Say YOU. LIKE. WHAT.
[02:54.27] I'VE
[02:54.76] GOT
[02:55.26] IN-
[02:55.73] SIDE?!
[02:58.73] 
[03:05.41] (AHHHHHHH)
[03:09.10] (OH. MY PEEEENIIIIIISSS)
[03:13.06] (AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)
[03:35.06] 
[03:13.61] [Instrumental Break]
[03:23.61] 
[03:40.17] So I falter on the second thought
[03:42.23] I keep on running like a chicken with its head cut off
[03:46.13] A counterfeited crooning cosmonaut
[03:48.32] A BIRDBRAIN, baby, I don't know when i'm supposed to stop
[03:51.79] Hit me with the flap down, mired in the earthbound (foul!)
[03:55.21] Bilious baby braying babble bent her beak (what a freak!)
[03:58.08] I put my neck upon the chopping block
[04:00.30] A BIRDBRAIN, baby, I don't think my head is coming off
[04:04.20] Baby, I don't know when I'm supposed to stop
[04:07.29] Baby, tell me if you think that I should stop
[04:10.20] Baby, I don't know when I'm supposed to stop!
[04:13.17] Baby-
[04:16.17] 
[04:14.20] FUCK
